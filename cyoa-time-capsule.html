                content: `The Founder's Day banner snapped like a firecracker above your head as you raced into Oakwood Elementary's courtyard. Your backpack bounced against your shoulders - inside was the special detective notebook you'd packed last night, full of blank pages waiting to be filled with clues. Today was supposed to be the most exciting day in Oakwood's history: the unearthing of the school's 50-year-old time capsule!

But something was wrong.

Where the round metal plaque marked "Time Capsule - Buried 1974" should have been, there was only a jagged hole in the concrete. Fresh dirt clumps dotted the pavement like chocolate sprinkles on ice cream. The shovel that was supposed to be used for the ceremony lay abandoned nearby, its blade still clean - whoever did this brought their own tools.

Principal Harris stood statue-still by the hole, her usually perfect bun coming loose. Her fingers clutched a walkie-talkie so tightly her knuckles turned white. "It's gone," she whispered, her breath making little clouds in the chilly morning air.

The night janitor, Mr. O'Reilly, shuffled his feet nearby. His flashlight swung wildly as he pointed toward the playground. "Saw some shadows slinking around near the swings... must've been about midnight. Thought it was just raccoons again." His voice dropped lower. "Heard metal scraping too."

You knelt beside the hole, your detective senses tingling. Three things jumped out at you:

1. <span class="evidence">Glittering screw holes</span> where the plaque had been pried up (someone strong or using tools)

2. <span class="evidence">Perfect rectangle shape</span> (they knew exactly where to dig)

3. <span class="evidence">Single set of footprints</span> leading toward the back gate (but none returning...)

A crowd of students began gathering behind you, their excited Founder's Day chatter turning to confused murmurs. You swallowed hard. This wasn't just missing homework or a stolen lunchbox - this was Oakwood's history vanishing in one night!`,

                content: `The security office smelled like someone had burned a whole bag of popcorn and then tried to cover it up with cheap air freshener. Officer Ruiz's cheeks turned pink as he quickly brushed orange cheese dust from his police uniform. "Don't mind the mess," he mumbled, knocking over an empty soda can that rolled under his desk with a clatter.

The monitor flickered to life, showing a black-and-white view of the empty courtyard. The timestamp read 11:30 PM - way past bedtime for any students. Officer Ruiz pressed fast-forward until---

"Wait! Go back!" you shouted, nearly knocking over your chair.

There! A shadowy figure in a baggy hoodie slunk into view, moving like a cartoon villain. They kept glancing over their shoulder as they knelt by the time capsule plaque. With a quick motion, they jammed a crowbar under the metal and---SCRREECH! Even through the silent video, you could almost hear the awful sound of metal prying loose.

The thief yanked out a dusty metal box (much smaller than you'd imagined) and tucked it under their arm like a football. But as they turned to run---CLINK! Something shiny fell from their pocket, bouncing twice on the pavement before coming to rest near the rose bushes.

"Freeze that frame!" you yelled, pointing at the screen. Officer Ruiz hit pause so hard the keyboard jumped.

There, glowing even in the grainy video, was the most beautiful clue yet: a keychain with a pendant shaped like an atom, its tiny green light still blinking. Like a firefly trapped in black-and-white world.

Officer Ruiz whistled. "Well I'll be... that's Ms. Vega's radioactive keychain. She won it at some science fair last year." He scratched his head. "Funny thing is, she was complaining just yesterday about losing it."

You peered closer at the frozen screen. Three new clues jumped out:

1. The thief wore <span class="evidence">black sneakers with red laces</span> (one was untied!)

2. The pendant's light <span class="evidence">blinked in a pattern</span> (..-... like Morse code?)

3. They'd come from the <span class="evidence">science wing</span> direction, not the front gates`,

                content: `The gardening club kids huddled near their tomato plants, their dirt-smudged faces serious as you approached. Maya Rodriguez nearly dropped her watering can when you asked about last night.

"I did see someone!" she said, her sunflower sprouts trembling as she leaned closer. "Right after the sunset bell rang. A person in a red hoodie with white stripes---like the soccer team's uniforms---was sprinting toward the back fence!" She pointed a muddy finger at the playground. "They kept looking behind them like they'd stolen a cookie from the cafeteria!"

Behind her, a tiny first-grader piped up: "I heard clanging noises too! Like a lunchbox full of spoons falling down the stairs!"

You scribbled notes in your detective notebook:
✏️ Red hoodie (soccer team style)
✏️ Running toward back fence at sunset
✏️ Suspicious clanging sounds

Then you noticed something even better---muddy footprints! They started near the time capsule hole, weaved past the jungle gym (with a scuff mark where someone might've tripped), and disappeared through the back gate.

Mr. Granger, the groundskeeper, stomped over with his rake. "That gate was wide open this morning!" He jabbed at the broken lock with a grimy fingernail. "I chain it up every night at six o'clock sharp. Someone wanted to get back in after hours."

You knelt beside the footprints. The tread pattern looked familiar---zigzag grooves, just like the shoes the soccer team wore for traction on wet fields. And the mud was still slightly damp!

A flash of red near the woods caught your eye. Was that...? You squinted. Just a crumpled soda can, but it gave you an idea.`,

                title: "CHAPTER 4: The Science Teacher's Alibi",
                content: `The door to Ms. Vega's science lab creaked open, releasing a wave of strange smells---vinegar, something burning, and a hint of peppermint. Beakers bubbled on a counter, and a poster of the solar system flapped where one corner had come loose. Ms. Vega stood at her desk, her wild curly hair tied back with what looked like a rubber band made of twisted paperclips.

When you held up the glowing keychain, her eyebrows shot up so high they nearly disappeared under her bangs. "My quantum atom keychain!" she gasped, snatching it from your hand. "This was stolen from my desk drawer three days ago!" She turned it over, inspecting it like a rare gem. "Where did you---? Wait. Does this have something to do with the missing time capsule?"

You nodded, watching as she absentmindedly tapped the keychain against her chin. The green light pulsed softly, casting weird shadows on the walls. While she muttered about "irresponsible lab behavior," your eyes wandered to her cluttered desk. Under her microscope, barely visible beneath a stack of graded papers, was a crumpled note. You carefully tugged it free.

The paper was torn at the bottom, but the words were clear:

*"Midnight. Old oak. Bring the---"*

The rest was missing. Your detective brain buzzed. Was this a meeting place? A hiding spot?

"Did you write this?" you asked, holding it up.

Ms. Vega adjusted her glasses and frowned. "No. And I've never seen it before." She peered closer. "Hmm. Those numbers at the bottom... 629.45. That looks like a library call number."

You examined the note again. The handwriting was neat but hurried, like someone had scribbled it in a rush. A faint smudge of dirt marked one corner, and the paper smelled slightly like... grass?

Three clues stood out:
1️⃣ The numbers could lead to a book in the library.
2️⃣ The old oak had to be the giant tree near the playground.
3️⃣ Someone had torn off part of the message---were they hiding something?

Ms. Vega sighed and tucked the keychain into her pocket. "If you find out who took this, let me know. I've got a few science experiments I'd like to try on them." She grinned, and you weren't entirely sure she was joking.`,

You frowned. His boots---usually caked in mud---were shiny clean today. Too clean, like he'd polished them. But when you glanced behind him, your pulse quickened. Fresh muddy footprints led down the basement stairs, their zigzag tread marks matching the ones by the time capsule!

"Uh," you said, pointing, "whose footprints are those?"

Mr. O'Reilly's mop handle clattered to the floor. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he wiped his hands on his pants. "Kids these days," he muttered. "Always tracking in dirt..."

You crouched beside the prints. Three things didn't add up:
1️⃣ The mud was still wet (someone had come this way recently!)
2️⃣ The prints were bigger than Mr. O'Reilly's boots
3️⃣ A shiny button glinted in the muck---like from a fancy coat

"Who else has basement keys?" you pressed.

The janitor tugged at his collar. "Just... just me and Principal Harris. And maybe---" He cut himself off.

A door slammed somewhere down the hall. Mr. O'Reilly flinched, then grabbed your shoulder. "Listen, kid. Some secrets are buried for a reason." His whisper smelled like coffee and peppermints. "That basement's no place for students."`,

A red hoodie with white stripes lay crumpled in the corner, one sleeve twisted like it had been yanked off in a hurry.

You picked it up, and something clinked against the floor. A shiny silver button with the Oakwood Elementary crest was caught in the zipper. Your breath hitched---only student council members wore these special buttons on their blazers!

Just then, Coach Simmons's whistle shrieked right behind you. "Hey! No one's allowed in here during---" He stopped when he saw the hoodie in your hands. "Oh. That's Liam's." He scratched his stubbly chin. "Kid's always forgetting stuff. Probably left it after yesterday's game."

"Liam Murphy?" you asked. "The student council vice president?"

"Yep, same kid." Coach tossed a soccer ball from hand to hand. "Good goalie, too. Though he's been acting weird lately---missed practice Monday, showed up all out of breath."

You examined the hoodie closer. Three clues stood out:
1️⃣ Grass stains on the elbows (like someone had been crawling on the field)
2️⃣ A pocket full of gravel (from the courtyard near the time capsule?)
3️⃣ That student council button---why was it torn off?

Coach frowned at the button. "Huh. Liam's usually so careful with that blazer. Must've been in a real hurry."

From the field outside, you heard shouts and the thump of a soccer ball. Liam was out there right now. But so was the student council office, just down the hall...`,

The muddy footprints squished under your sneakers, still fresh enough to leave deep marks. Whoever made them had been running---the prints were far apart, with long scrapes where they'd slipped. You followed them past:

1️⃣ A broken spiderweb (recently torn)
2️⃣ A scattered pile of acorns (like someone kicked them)
3️⃣ A scratched-up tree with bark peeling off in chunks

Then---the trail vanished.

Right at a massive fallen tree trunk, the footprints disappeared. The trunk's bark had strange parallel scratches, too straight to be from an animal. Your fingers brushed the marks---they felt rough and fresh.

As you crouched down, something metal glinted in the leaf litter. A locker key! You wiped off the dirt, revealing the number "217" stamped on its side. It was warm, like it had been in someone's pocket recently.

CRACK.

The sound of a breaking twig made your heart leap into your throat. You spun around just in time to see:

- A flash of red fabric (like the soccer hoodie?)
- A shoe with zigzag soles (matching the muddy prints!)
- The figure ducking behind an oak tree

The book creaked like it hadn't been opened in years. As you flipped to page 629.45 (just like Ms. Vega's note said!), a brittle photograph fluttered into your lap. It showed a group of kids in bell-bottom jeans burying---

"Wait... two capsules?" you whispered.

The black-and-white photo clearly showed:
1️⃣ A fancy metal box (students smiling as they buried it)
2️⃣ A nearly identical box nearby (being hidden behind some bushes)

The caption below read: "Time capsule and decoy placed for security. Only Principal McGee knows the true location." Your hands trembled. No one had ever mentioned a decoy!

As you turned the photo over, a handwritten note in purple ink screamed up at you:

*"The real one is where the shadow points at noon."*

The words looked recently written---the ink hadn't even fully faded! You glanced at the library clock: 11:47 AM. Just thirteen minutes until the clue might make sense!

But something else bothered you...

- The photo had five fingerprints smudging one corner (someone else had looked at this recently!)
- The decoy capsule's hiding spot showed a distinctive oak tree in the background (still on school property!)
- The handwriting matched no teacher you knew (spiky letters with weirdly perfect dots over the i's)

Your fingers plunged into the cool earth, wiggling past pebbles and wriggling worms until---<em>clink!</em> Something smooth and cold met your touch.

Perched on the lowest branch like a shadowy owl sat a figure in a <span class="evidence">black hoodie</span>, their face hidden behind sunglasses and a medical mask. One gloved hand gripped the bark so tightly their knuckles turned white.

"You shouldn't be here," they whispered. Their voice sounded familiar, but you couldn't place it---like when someone talks with their mouth full.

Sunlight streamed through the blinds, painting stripes across Principal Harris's neat desk. When you placed the glowing green keychain in front of her, her usual warm smile melted like an ice cube in July.

"That's... impossible," she whispered. Her fingers trembled as she picked it up, turning it over and over like she was trying to wake up from a dream. "This keychain was sealed inside the original time capsule fifty years ago. It belonged to my grandfather, Principal McGee."

A grandfather clock in the corner ticked loudly as she opened her top desk drawer with a small key. From beneath a stack of perfect attendance certificates, she pulled out <span class="evidence">an identical keychain</span>---except this one had a <span class="evidence">blue pendant</span> that pulsed softly.

"See?" She placed them side by side. "Green and blue. They were a set. My grandfather kept the blue one, and the green one went in the..." Her voice trailed off as she stared at you. "But if the green one was buried, how is it here now?"

You noticed three strange things:
1. The <span class="evidence">blue pendant</span> had a tiny crack the green one didn't
2. A <span class="evidence">photo on the wall</span> showed Principal McGee holding just the blue keychain
3. The desk drawer had <span class="evidence">fresh scratches</span> around the lock

From the hallway came the sound of hurried footsteps, then silence. Principal Harris quickly closed her hand around both keychains. "This means someone dug up the original capsule long before yesterday," she said quietly. "But why? And where is it now?"`,

"I didn't steal anything!" he blurted before you could speak. His cleats dug into the grass. "But... I did see something weird last night."

He led you to the student council office, empty except for a half-eaten granola bar on the president's desk. With a glance at the door, Liam dropped to his knees near the trophy case. His fingers found a <span class="evidence">loose floorboard</span> you'd never have noticed---its edge worn smooth from years of secret lifting.

Beneath it lay:
1. A <span class="evidence">yellowed note</span> that smelled like old books:
   <em>"The tunnels still run under the school. Meet me where it began.---E.R."</em>
2. A <span class="evidence">rusted key</span> tied to the note with blue string
3. A <span class="evidence">1974 penny</span> glued to the corner

Liam's voice dropped to a whisper. "E.R. is Emily Rivers. Student council president in 1974---the year they buried the capsule." He pointed to a faded photo on the wall of a serious girl with braids. "I found this when I was hiding my... um... unfinished homework."

You studied the note. The handwriting matched the library photo's back! Three clues stood out:
✏️ <span class="evidence">Blue string</span> (same color as the principal's keychain)
✏️ <span class="evidence">"Where it began"</span> (the time capsule spot? The old oak tree?)
✏️ <span class="evidence">1974 penny</span> (deliberately placed---but why?)

Liam fidgeted with the key. "Last night I saw someone come OUT of the tunnel by the boiler room. They were carrying..." He gulped. "Something shaped like the time capsule, but... older looking?"

Outside, a whistle blew. "That's Coach!" Liam panicked. "I'm late for practice!" He shoved the key into your hand. "Don't tell anyone I showed you this!"`,

Something crunched under your shoe as you stepped inside. You lifted your foot to find <span class="evidence">shards of a broken picture frame</span>. The photo inside showed last year's student council smiling in front of the oak tree. Someone had drawn black X's over three faces with a marker.

Behind the torn poster, your fingers brushed against something stiff and crinkly. Taped to the wall were <span class="evidence">architectural blueprints</span> marked in bold red letters:

Just as the twelfth chime faded, two figures emerged from behind the science wing.

Mr. O'Reilly, the janitor, shuffled forward gripping a <span class="evidence">rusty shovel</span>. Moonlight glinted off the blade, showing fresh scratches in the metal. His usual blue uniform was replaced by black clothes that made him nearly invisible in the darkness.

Beside him, Ms. Vega clutched a <span class="evidence">crumbling leather journal</span> to her chest. The cover was embossed with faded gold letters: <em>"Oakwood Elementary - Restricted Archives."</em>

"We're too late," the janitor muttered, his voice as gravelly as the path beneath his boots. "Should've left the past buried."

Ms. Vega flipped open the journal to a page titled <em>"The Real Founder's Secret."</em> Your eyes widened as you glimpsed:
- A yellowed newspaper clipping about the school's 1921 groundbreaking
- A hand-drawn map with "X" marks around the oak tree
- A black-and-white photo of workers digging a <em>second hole</em> near the playground

As you leaned closer, your foot came down on a dry twig. The <em>SNAP!</em> echoed through the silent playground.

Both adults spun toward your hiding spot. Ms. Vega gasped, her glasses flashing in the moonlight. Mr. O'Reilly raised the shovel like a weapon.

The moonlight reflected in her wide eyes as she dropped the shovel with a clang. Her usual crisp blazer was hidden under the janitor's baggy coat, and her hands---normally decorated with colorful rings---were smeared with dirt.

"I... I had to protect the school's reputation," she whispered, her voice cracking. She pointed to the journal Ms. Vega still held. "That time capsule contained proof Oakwood was built on land stolen from the Miller family. My grandfather buried the evidence, and I couldn't let it come to light now---not with the school's 100th anniversary coming up."

Ms. Vega stepped forward, her face pale. "But destroying history isn't the answer, Sarah," she said gently. "The Millers deserve to know the truth."

Just then, flashing red and blue lights lit up the playground. Police officers rushed toward you, their radios crackling. Principal Harris hung her head as she handed the journal to the chief.

"You're quite the detective," the chief told you, flipping through the journal's pages. "This evidence could help right a 100-year-old wrong."

                content: `The time capsule's rusty hinges screamed in protest as you pried it open. A puff of stale air escaped, carrying the scent of old metal and something faintly sour. Inside, three objects lay nestled in crumbling yellowed newspaper:

1. A 1919 Land Deed with a rusty brown stain splashed across the Whitmore Family name. The paper felt brittle as autumn leaves as you carefully unfolded it, revealing a map of the woods behind school - but with property lines that didn't match current maps.

2. A Rusted Skeleton Key dangling from a tag that read "GATE 5" in shaky handwriting. When you touched it, a flake of red paint came off on your finger. The key was ice-cold, like it had been buried in snow.

3. A Hand-Drawn Map showing seven X's deep in the forest. Beneath each was a tiny date spanning 1918-1921. The paper trembled in your suddenly sweaty hands as you realized - these weren't treasure marks. They were graves.

Ms. Vega's glasses fogged up as she gasped. "This...this isn't our time capsule." Her voice was barely a whisper. "Someone switched them."

The janitor crossed himself, his face pale. "We should've never dug this up," he muttered. "Some secrets..." A distant siren cut him off, growing louder by the second.

As the adults argued, you quietly slipped the key into your pocket. It weighed more than it should have, like it was tugging you toward the woods. The map's X's seemed to glow slightly in the fading light.

Three Mysteries Remained:
• Why did the deed have a bloodstain?
• Where was Gate 5 - the school only had 4 gates!
• Who was buried in those woods 100 years ago?

The sirens were close now. You had seconds to decide - hand everything over to the police, or...`,
